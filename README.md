As technology is used in every aspect of our lives, the country's economy is no exception. Data science deals 
with massive amounts of data using modern tools and techniques and enables better decision making, 
predictive analysis, and pattern discovery. Using data science in GDP analysis enables us to know the 
factors that are affecting the GDP per capita of various countries. This helps to focus on the areas that help 
to foster economic development.
